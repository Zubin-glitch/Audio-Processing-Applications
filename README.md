## Introduction

Provide a brief overview of your project, its purpose, and its goals. Mention any dependencies required to run the project.

## Directories

This project is organized into four directories, each containing code for specific tasks:

1. **Speech Recognition 101**: Contains code for basic speech recognition using PyAudio for live recording on your device and how to visualize collected data for better analysis.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Contains code for sentiment analysis of audio files using Assembly AI's API.
3. **Podcast Summarization**: Contains code for podcast summarization with a creative Streamlit user interface.
4. **Real-Time Speech Recognition**: Contains code for real-time speech recognition using AAI's speech recognition model with OpenAI API integration to transcribe speech and generate responses using ChatGPT.

## Installation

You could clone the repo and use the code specific to your use case. You would need to acquire API tokens from Assembly AI and ChatGPT and fill them into the code wherever needed.

## License
Please feel free to use this code for your personal projects, as is, with your personal API tokens.
